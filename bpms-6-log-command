    Log Command CleanUp

Production support procedures should be introduced to ensure the BPM environment remains healthy.

The BPMS engine produces both runtime and audit information. Runtime data is managed and cleaned-up automatically by the engine when certain life cycle events occur such as:

    process instance information will be removed upon process instance completion
    work item information will be removed upon work item completion
    task instance information (including content) will be removed upon completion of a process instance that given tasks belongs to.

Session information clean up depends on the runtime strategy selected

    singleton - won't be removed at all
    per request will be removed as soon as given request ends
    per process instance - will be removed when process instance mapped to given session completes (or aborts)
    executor's request and error information is not removed

However, by default audit information held in the following tables will not be cleaned-up automatically.

    Process Instance Log
    Node Instance Log
    Variable Instance Log
    Task Audit Log
    TaskEventLog
    Error Info Log
    Request Info Log

The BPMS product provides two solutions for handling this:

    scheduled job running in background at defined intervals
    manual clean up by taking advantage of the Kie-Server audit API.

Job Storage

Job information is stored in the following BPM database table: RequestInfo
Automatic CleanUp Using the Kie-Server Rest API:

The Kie-server api documentation can be found here: http://localhost:8080/kie-server/docs/index.html

The server/jobs services provide a set of methods for managing the cleanup jobs. This is a brief summary of the operations provided:

    server/jobs - GET
    server/jobs - POST
    server/jobs/commands/{cmd} - GET
    server/jobs/keys/{key} - GET
    server/jobs/{jobId} - DELETE
    server/jobs/{jobId} - GET
    server/jobs/{jobId} - PUT

A list of the various commands can be found here: https://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm/tree/master/jbpm-services/jbpm-executor/src/main/java/org/jbpm/executor/commands

Detailed explanation of the BPM executor can be found here: https://docs.jboss.org/jbpm/v6.4/userguide/ch24.html#d0e29454

The following examples related to the LogCleanUpCommand.

The LogCleanUpCommand support the following list of config parameters:

    SkipProcessLog - indicates if clean up of process logs should be omitted (true|false)
    SkipTaskLog - indicates if clean up of task logs should be omitted (true|false)
    SkipExecutorLog - indicates if clean up of executor logs should be omitted (true|false)
    DateFormat - date format for further date related params - if not given yyyy-MM-dd is used (pattern of SimpleDateFormat class)
    EmfName - name of entity manager factory to be used for queries (valid persistence unit name)
    SingleRun - indicates if execution should be single run only (true|false)
    NextRun - provides next execution time (valid time expression e.g. 1d, 5h, etc)
    OlderThan - indicates what logs should be deleted - older than given date
    OlderThanPeriod - indicated what logs should be deleted older than given time expression (valid time expression e.g. 1d, 5h, etc)
    ForProcess - indicates logs to be deleted only for given process definition
    ForDeployment - indicates logs to be deleted that are from given deployment id

Example 1: - Create a job that executes every day to remove all log entries for a particular process

POST - http://localhost:8080/kie-server/services/rest/server/jobs

Headers:
